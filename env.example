# Environment Variables

## Liveblocks Configuration

To enable commenting functionality, you need to configure Liveblocks:

1. Sign up at https://liveblocks.io
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your public API key from the project dashboard
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```
PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key_here
```

5. Restart your development server

## Required Variables

- `PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your Liveblocks public API key (starts with `pk_`)

## Development vs Production

- For development: Use your development key (starts with `pk_dev_`)
- For production: Use your production key (starts with `pk_live_`)

## Security Note

The public key is safe to expose in client-side code. Never put your secret key in environment variables that are exposed to the client.
