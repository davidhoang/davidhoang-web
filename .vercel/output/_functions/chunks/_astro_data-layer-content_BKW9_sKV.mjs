Engineering encompasses a broad range of disciplines and involves critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration. Many engineering disciplines have a role called a Design Engineer—a title that has been more popular in software in recent years. Design Engineers tend to work on products and systems that involve adapting and using complex scientific and mathematical techniques. In essence, they work on high technical challenges that requires strong design consideration. Today, we’re seeing Design Engineers become a popular role in software, and this isn’t the first time new roles/practices emerged.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the role of a Data Scientist became popular as data became increasingly abundant through the internet, social media, and digital technologies. Though the practice of statistics, analytics in a domain-specific knowledge existed before Data Science, companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon were the pioneers leveraging data analytics to drive decision-making, improving user experiences, and growing the business. At the time, the practice was maturing in adoption and there was a shortage of talent who could do the role. Today it seems rare for any tech company to not have a Data Scientist.\n\nData Science was transformative in tech in the 2010s. In the age of LLMs, multi-device interfaces, and everything seemingly being programming, Design Engineering will be the transformative practice in the 2020s.\n\n![Image of design engineering](/images/writing/2024-03-design-engineering.jpeg)\n\nDesign Engineering is not simply a re-brand of product design. Whether we like it or not, tech has a tendency to consolidate roles. Interaction Designers, UX Designers, UI Designers, and Visual Designers became Product Designers. Graphic Designers, Illustrators, Communications Designers, and Marketing Designers became Brand Designers.\n\nTo say Design Engineering is combining product design and front-end development dilutes what the value the practice brings. Like a minestrone, the Arnold Palmer, or Cronut, Design Engineering is a true blend of two conventional roles. Design Engineers have deep knowledge in technological systems while scaling interface quality. They naturally fit in design crit or reviewing code with engineering.\n\n## Role, responsibility, and impact\nThere are three core areas Design Engineering is the top candidate for leading: product architecture, design infrastructure, and 0-1 R&D. These three areas do not encapsulate everything a Design Engineer might do, and the hope is to provide three concrete examples.\n\n### Product architecture\nIt makes sense for a Design Engineer, a role which balances technical systems and end user experiences, to be close to product architecture. In products that are authoring tools (Figma for design, Replit for code, Webflow for websites) it's important to think beyond isolated features but the foundational capabilities of what your product can do. Design Engineers have the right skills to explore aspects such as information architecture of a product and also understand the technical logic of how such things function.\n\n### Design infrastructure\nDesign Engineers are naturals at design infrastructure—the underlying tools and systems to scale design. This might be contributing to component libraries, building internal tools to increase efficiency, or prototyping new patterns and interactions to inform the future of their software.\n\nIn many cases, Design Engineers are brought in to prototype experiences that otherwise would be nearly impossible in static mockups in Figma. When you’re dealing with an interaction with a Language Server Protocol (LSP) or layout engine for a site builder, you have to build the prototype in code.\n\n0-1 R&D\nExploring new product directions can be a need for an early stage company needing to pivot in direction or an established company looking for new growth opportunities. These initiatives are usually not funded due to the perceived risk of pulling people off teams to do this unproven work. Due to the multi-disciplinary skillsets of Design Engineers, they're able to explore this space much quicker and more effective than other teams.\n\n## Org structure\nMy philosophy on org design is optimize for the desired results, not the existing org chart. I’ve been at places where Design Engineers reported to me (Design) and others where they report to Engineering. For the sake of Design Engineers, its important to have a clear reporting line. Creative Technologists (made popular at Airbnb and Uber) in the 2010s have never recovered from the trauma of having unclear expectations conflicting priorities of multiple orgs.\n\n##Design Engineering will revolutionize the 2020s\nAs we navigate what seems to be a tech paradigm shift with LLMs, AI applications, and multi-device experiences, Design Engineers will be this decade’s Data Scientist. Expect talent to be rare and continued definition of the impact of the role.\n\nMy hope is not for designers to simply change their title to Design Engineer on LinkedIn. It’s uncertain if every company needs a Design Engineer. However, I am confident authoring environments or work with complex interactions/ data need Design Engineers. Snap, Retool, Replit, Uber, Square, Open AI, and The Browser Company are a few examples of companies that have Design Engineers on their software teams.\n\nData was the currency in the web era of social and ad tech. Now it’s trained data (LLMs) presented in multi-device interfaces. When it comes to an emerging function in a paradigm shift in tech, the Design Engineer is the new Data Scientist. Let’s see if that’s true in ten years.","src/content/writing/design-engineering.md","1299bc3271392ea6",{html:21,metadata:22},"<p>In software, engineering and design are infantile in existence compared to other sectors: mechanical, electrical, aerospace, and environmental engineering.

Every time I say I’m taking a sabbatical, it never happens. One day, I’ll make sure it happens. I took about a week off before advising with Replit, then ultimately joining the company. Many people ask what made me choose the software creation platform over other opportunities I had, and I’ll share with you my framework for choosing.\n\n\"What are you optimizing for?\"\nI've asked this question to every person I've interviewed as a hiring manager for the past seven years. \"What are you optimizing for?\" helps candidates think bigger about what’s important to them in their next opportunity. Though title and comp are important factors, there are more underlying motivations, sometimes not realized by the candidate in conversations. Recruiter or hiring managers should understand candidate needs and work backwards from there.\n\nAnswers from candidates may be surprising. It might be a Software Engineer wanting to move into a Technical Product Manager (TPM) or a Product Designer with the desire to make impact in a different industry. Perhaps it is looking for a different pace/cadence in their work life. Take a look at my own notes of my optimization list.\n\n![Image showing optimization list](/images/blog/img-2023-01-05-choosing-company.jpeg)\n\nEarly stage company building\nDesign/dev tools, Marketplaces, or Creator Economy\nThis might be my last job as an operator. Make it count.\nHere’s the kicker—I wrote this list before I joined Webflow, not after I left. My optimization list is something I’ve had clarity for several years and not only after I decided to leave. This artifact helps you guide what you’re looking for. What you optimize for doesn’t show up in job descriptions or aggregators. They emerge in conversation. Once you know what you're optimizing for, stack rank priorities.\n\n## The three P's\nOn the Design MBA Podcast, Lattice SVP of Design Jared Erondu spoke about the decision to join Lattice as a founding designer after doing High Resolution. He mentioned three P's for him: People, Purpose, and Pay. Inspired by Erondu (which we all are), I reflected on my own of what a post-Webflow world looked like for me. My stack ranked three P's were Purpose, Product, and People.\n\nPurpose\nKimber Lockhart, my first manager and the person who hired me at One Medical, wrote, Don't create a sense of urgency, foster a sense of purpose. This mantra stuck with me everywhere else I’ve gone. For me, purpose is your life version of being mission-driven.\n\nWork is a big aspect of my life, and it’s the best environment for me to contribute to something meaningful. Purpose in the workplace can be multi-fold. It could be helping build a product that has a positive impact on the world, helping the company scale effectively, or growing humans on the team. My hope is what I contribute to exceeds my own lifetime.\n\nProduct\nIf I can’t be excited about the product, I won’t join the company. The product is the artifact that delivers purpose. Regardless of title, compensation, or any other incentives, I will never work at a company where I don't believe in the product or can’t be enthused by developing it. I have no interest in being a Chief Design Officer at a place where material change can’t be made and the product is shitty. I care more about the product and what can be achieved vs. the notoriety of design leadership royalty.\n\nPeople\nAt first glance, this may be surprising for some that People is the last one in this stack rank. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about people, but if Purpose and Product aren’t right, it doesn’t matter who I work with. There are many people in my career I’d love to work with again or start something with friends, but if it’s not the right company, it doesn’t matter. That said, it’s usually the case I’m working with people at multiple companies that check all three P’s.\n\nI optimize work for working, not making friends. I’m not looking for a family at the workplace and there to achieve something with a team. Through that, many friendships are formed organically; not optimizing for it, but they happen.\n\nUnderstanding the signals and anti-goals\nAs you have conversations, identify what signals might tell you if a role is a good fit for you. Signals aren’t red flags and more factors to help you consider making a decision. One person’s red flag might be another person’s green flag. It all depends on what each person is optimizing for. For example, something I optimize for is working at a company where I know it’s a multi-year effort, not because I want to rest and vest, but know it’s going to be a long-term investment. In one of the interviews I had, I mentioned this. The person’s answer was, “Oh, you could be here a year.” That’s when I knew it wasn’t the right fit for me. Again, the opportunity was great and I didn’t view it as a red flag but had the utmost clarity in what I was seeking.\n\nAnti-goals come before signals and are a strong filter before conversations. These aren’t essential, but they help in creating constraints to guide you along the way. A few of the anti-goals I established were:\n\nI do not care about title whatsoever. I’m in a privileged point in my career where it’s no longer important\nOrg size: I’ve led teams 30-40 people before. I knew in a market decimated by layoffs and the rise of AI, orgs would look differently and number of people on the team wouldn’t be a measure of success\nNo repeating of “the same job.” I wanted to make sure wherever I ended up presented a new challenge and opportunity for me to grow as a person.\nRecap\nDon't spend all your time career planning, but have an idea of what makes sense for you. Like all the good things in life, they happen organically when you’re not trying too hard to make it happen.\n\nIdentify what you're optimizing for\nEstablish a priority framework (Note: they don't have to start with the letter P)\nUnderstand signals and anti-goals\nThe reflection I ask people who are considering a job change is, \"Are you running towards an opportunity or running away from one?\" If the place you work at is a dumpster fire and you need to get a new job immediately, then GTFO. However, if what you're running towards isn't clear and the current role you're at is meeting your needs, then create more time. Having this rubric already established made it obvious what the right choice would be.","src/content/writing/choosing-a-company.md","a61e218d5f3fac76",{html:53,metadata:54},"<p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.proofofconcept.pub/p/choosing-a-company-to-join\">Proof of Concept</a></p>\n<p>This April, I made a big life change and switched companies after nearly four years at the previous one.

I we were living on Mars, I’d be 21! Early in my career, I was always the youngest person on the team or at the company. I always gravitated proving that being young didn’t mean you could tag along with the big kids. In college, I took the advanced painting classes as a Freshman to prove this point. Now I find myself often the oldest person and working with colleagues who were born after my favorite films.\n\nTo celebrate, I’ll reflect on 40 things I learned in my years on Planet Earth. They’re a combination of professional and personal insights. Though the list is numbered, they are not ranked in a particular order—just as I thought of them. The ordered list helps with counting.\n\n1. If you work in tech or startups, focus on the craft of your work. Avoid, \"the scene.\" For some, having a startup is a lifestyle and there are always people who want to appear like they are doing stuff but don't care about the work.\n2. It's okay to change and not be the same person you used to be. In fact, it's encouraged.\n3. Don't worry about being single; enjoy it. What people say you'll find love when you're not looking for it is usually true.\n4. When working at fast growth startups, the people you couldn't stand or not get along with were likely under the same pressure you were—hence all the tension. Down the road, most of the people I conflicted with became friends once we were successful (winning cures all).\n5. Throughout my career, I've told every hiring manager that I don't want to have to think about money. This was true entry level to now. Not having to pay the bills and focus on the mission and vision of work is truly a blessing.\n6. Find the soundtrack to your lie—a song that follows you wherever you go—driving, traveling, at a coffee shop. Mine is, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by Tears For Fears.\n7. When applied correctly, Catholic Guilt is a feature, not a bug.\n8. Make room for serendipity in your life.\n9. Put your phone in another room or out of reach of your bedside. Get a proper analog alarm clock. You'll sleep better and stress less.\n10. Live in New York at some point in your life. It's one way to experience the whole world and have your friends come to you.\n11. Unless something unethical is happening, if you're considering leaving, stay a few months longer. The regret of staying longer and it continuing to not improve is much lower than if you leave too soon and things turn around. It can take multiple years to turn something around.\n12. You have only one body in this lifetime (for now), and it doesn't regenerate (for now). Take care of your body, especially your lower back. You'll get to the age where injury occurs because you slept in an awkward position!\n13. Don't cheat on your significant other. Not only is it the wrong thing to do, it also feels like a lot of work to manage it all. If you cheat on someone don't be surprised if someone does the same to you.\n14. The oppressed often become oppressors.\n15. The quarter life crisis is overrated. If you're worried about your life at 25…stop. Whatever you experience between age 25 to 32 probably does not matter at all.\n16. What annoys you about younger people are likely things that annoyed other people when you were young. Remember that.\n17. It's very possible that losing a pet will be harder on you than losing friends who are human. I don't know how to explain it. Don't be surprised if you feel that way.\n18. A top indicator of relationship success will be if you can successfully share a bathroom together.\n19. Have a personal website and a homepage on the internet. It's your source of truth for your ideas. Growing up along with the internet, I can't tell you how powerful of an idea publishing for yourself online was. We take it for granted. Make a now page and share what you're up to.\n20. The nerds and people teased in high school often turn out to be the cool people. I remember a few friends of mine getting made fun of for listening to Daft Punk.\n21. Friendships don't have to last forever. Some will fade as you grow older. It's okay to let it go and appreciate what you had.\n22. You will meet some people in your life who are your soulmate in an alternate universe. Don't cause an incursion. Appreciate how they are doing in the other reality.\n23. There is no success without a successor. Share your knowledge and wisdom with the future generation.

I we were living on Mars, I’d be 21! Early in my career, I was always the youngest person on the team or at the company. I always gravitated proving that being young didn’t mean you could tag along with the big kids. In college, I took the advanced painting classes as a Freshman to prove this point. Now I find myself often the oldest person and working with colleagues who were born after my favorite films.</p>\n<p>To celebrate, I’ll reflect on 40 things I learned in my years on Planet Earth. They’re a combination of professional and personal insights. Though the list is numbered, they are not ranked in a particular order—just as I thought of them. The ordered list helps with counting.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you work in tech or startups, focus on the craft of your work. Avoid, “the scene.” For some, having a startup is a lifestyle and there are always people who want to appear like they are doing stuff but don’t care about the work.</li>\n<li>It’s okay to change and not be the same person you used to be. In fact, it’s encouraged.</li>\n<li>Don’t worry about being single; enjoy it. What people say you’ll find love when you’re not looking for it is usually true.</li>\n<li>When working at fast growth startups, the people you couldn’t stand or not get along with were likely under the same pressure you were—hence all the tension. Down the road, most of the people I conflicted with became friends once we were successful (winning cures all).</li>\n<li>Throughout my career, I’ve told every hiring manager that I don’t want to have to think about money. This was true entry level to now. Not having to pay the bills and focus on the mission and vision of work is truly a blessing.</li>\n<li>Find the soundtrack to your lie—a song that follows you wherever you go—driving, traveling, at a coffee shop. Mine is, “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by Tears For Fears.</li>\n<li>When applied correctly, Catholic Guilt is a feature, not a bug.</li>\n<li>Make room for serendipity in your life.</li>\n<li>Put your phone in another room or out of reach of your bedside. Get a proper analog alarm clock. You’ll sleep better and stress less.</li>\n<li>Live in New York at some point in your life. It’s one way to experience the whole world and have your friends come to you.</li>\n<li>Unless something unethical is happening, if you’re considering leaving, stay a few months longer. The regret of staying longer and it continuing to not improve is much lower than if you leave too soon and things turn around. It can take multiple years to turn something around.</li>\n<li>You have only one body in this lifetime (for now), and it doesn’t regenerate (for now). Take care of your body, especially your lower back. You’ll get to the age where injury occurs because you slept in an awkward position!</li>\n<li>Don’t cheat on your significant other. Not only is it the wrong thing to do, it also feels like a lot of work to manage it all. If you cheat on someone don’t be surprised if someone does the same to you.</li>\n<li>The oppressed often become oppressors.</li>\n<li>The quarter life crisis is overrated. If you’re worried about your life at 25…stop. Whatever you experience between age 25 to 32 probably does not matter at all.</li>\n<li>What annoys you about younger people are likely things that annoyed other people when you were young. Remember that.</li>\n<li>It’s very possible that losing a pet will be harder on you than losing friends who are human. I don’t know how to explain it. Don’t be surprised if you feel that way.</li>\n<li>A top indicator of relationship success will be if you can successfully share a bathroom together.</li>\n<li>Have a personal website and a homepage on the internet. It’s your source of truth for your ideas. Growing up along with the internet, I can’t tell you how powerful of an idea publishing for yourself online was. We take it for granted. Make a now page and share what you’re up to.</li>\n<li>The nerds and people teased in high school often turn out to be the cool people. I remember a few friends of mine getting made fun of for listening to Daft Punk.</li>\n<li>Friendships don’t have to last forever. Some will fade as you grow older. It’s okay to let it go and appreciate what you had.</li>\n<li>You will meet some people in your life who are your soulmate in an alternate universe. Don’t cause an incursion. Appreciate how they are doing in the other reality.</li>\n<li>There is no success without a successor. Share your knowledge and wisdom with the future generation.

Let’s talk about the other side of the cap table on why it’s important for an investment round to have a designer be a part of it\n\n“Let me know how  I can be helpful” is a running joke of dudes (it’s always a dude) in Patagonia vests, particularly in Silicon Valley. I truly when these words are backed with authentic action, it is so impactful and powerful for founders. Many pre-seed companies need capital to keep their idea alive. There are many reasons to have a designer on your cap table; some more obvious than others. \n\n## Design help in the product and brand\nLet’s start with the obvious one...design. Unless one of the founders is a designer, there’s a chance that early-stage startups haven’t hired a designer yet. This might sound blasphemous, but the reality is a lot of funding in early startups will go to engineering to build the product. The amount of value a designer can guide an early-stage startup. Form Capital is a great example of this. They offer actual design work with their portfolios in the form of design sprints and working closely with founders.\n\n## Experience and system design\nExperience is key and less visible than working on the startup’s product itself. When you make a decision on something, you’re designing an outcome. Early on, many companies are not prioritizing systems due to the need to move fast. Designers, some of the best systems thinkers, can offer consideration and a point of view that allows you to move fast without facing unintended consequences later on.\n\nThe area I’ve observed this to be very helpful is thinking about recruiting and hiring DEI initiatives, and accessibility. There are not things that should be bolted on after you scale but considered from the very beginning. Designers also think a lot about macro-level interaction design, such as journey mapping and user experiences. Recruiting, hiring, and onboarding are some of the most crucial moments as your startup grows, and having a designer think about some of these opportunities add tremendous value.\n\nMany designers also have experience doing customer research, at least enough to be dangerous. This can help amplify product validation of what to work on next while moving quickly. In a world where research is often first in the chopping block, it’s unlikely a founding team has a researcher, and design can bridge that gap for quite some time.\n\n## Helping with hiring your first designer\nThere is no harder role to fill in design than the founding designer at a startup. An angel investor who is a designer fill gaps in your startup. Even with a founder as a designer, they can benefit from an experienced advisor to help them navigate. An advisor has a great network of designers that your company can tap into.\n\nThese are a few examples of how a designer can help on your cap table. There’s this quote from the sci-fi cartoon Futurama, “When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” In many ways, I believe this is the value design angel investors bring.\n\nNotes\n- If you want to learn more, Mike Kruzeniski has a great resource called design angels with really comprehensive information.\n- I highly recommend the book “Angel Investing: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups” by David S.

The vivid dream turned into a reality when [Paige Finn Doherty](https://paigefinndoherty.com/) inspired me to make it real by investing in a syndicate she led. The experience was so inclusive it was a rude awakening for me on what’s really needed to get started.\n\nAlumni designers who found success early at Silicon Valley startups formed entities like Designer Fund, Combine VC, and Form Capital. They’ve set the vision on what design can play in the role of venture capital. Despite that, there's still a large opportunity for designers to focus on individual angel investors.\n\nDesign continues to struggle to find that proverbial seat at the table on the executive level. We hear about the importance of design, yet we don’t see much representation at the most crucial level. Designers may not have a seat at the table at companies until there are more seats occupied on the cap table of design angel investors to advocate for it from the other side. A design angel investor has a proven track record of what happens when Design is (or isn’t) represented in leadership and strategy.\n\nI’ve dipped my toes in many different roles, and I am a designer at heart. I love solving problems to create elegant software experiences for humans. In the investment world, you might call me an operator, which is a cool word for someone who works at a company. I work at Webflow as an operator leading Design, a practice I’ve done for almost as long as some of the founders I work with have been alive. I also have experience in scaling startups and been a part of product leadership teams which brought me closer to how a company operates.\n\nI’m still a neophyte when it comes to angel investing, and there are so many more qualified people who can tell you about angel investing than I can. What I can offer is a fresh perspective of a designer who wanted to invest in founders and startups. I’ll tell you what I tell all founders I invest in: you can get more money from other angel investors, but I can give you other forms of value if I’m on your cap table. I’m deliberately letting people carry me to be involved and gain experience. You won’t see me cutting big checks or leading rounds yet for two simple reasons:\n\n1. I’m not ready to write big checks based on how much I’m willing to allocate in angel investing\n\n2. My primary commitment is as an operator and leading a round is time-consuming\n\nThis is what makes micro-investing so appealing. I get to take high risk while keeping it low-key. Let’s not pretend that you don’t need money to invest. What people might not realize is the size of the check, which ranges from $1,000 to $100,000 (or more). I have absolutely no shame in the size of the check I write at this moment.\n\nThough value is typically attributed to the size of the check you commit to, you can add value in so many other ways. Let’s go through a hypothetical situation. If you invest $1,000 in a round as a value add investor when others might be putting in $100,000, then chances are you might feel 100x inferior—I know I did. Investment starts with the check and doesn’t end with it.\n\nAn angel investor once told me that the value you can deliver as a value add investor can truly change the trajectory of a startup’s success. As an experienced operator, a quick call or email to advise a group of founders can save them time and money from figuring out themselves. So you might cut a $100,000 check, but you might also provide guidance for a startup to save them hundreds of thousands of dollars. This perspective completely changed how I viewed my tiny investment. A $100,000 check helps only when it converts to value.\n\n## The opportunity for designers in venture\nWhy would designers want to become angel investors? Isn’t that what product managers and engineers with successful exits do? That’s the problem within itself...why not us?\n\n### Guiding design decisions\nBy the time designer joins a company, there is already so much legacy debt. Working with early startups gives us the opportunity to be proactive about problem-solving and having a design advisor can help flag dependencies early on.\n\n### Product strategy\nDesigners talk a lot about how they’d like to have more product influence in the companies they work at. This has resulted in some product designers pivoting into product management. There are other ways aside from a career change to have product influence, and startup advising is a great way to flex your product strategy muscle.\n\n### Angel investing is mentorship\nDesign leader coach Mia Blume (formerly IDEO, Pinterest, and Square) often speaks about how we need sponsorship in design leadership. One way to sponsor is to allocate funds to it. By committing to a check, even at a smaller size, it’s representative of your belief in the founders and their ambitions. If you don’t have the privilege of allocating funds to investments, see how you can get involved such as being an advisor to a startup.\n\nBeing an accredited investor before meant you possessed a certain level of capital, but with the Series 65, Series 7, or Series 82 exams are [new pathways for accreditation](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/small-business-compliance-guides/amendments-accredited-investor-definition). There’s no better time to get started.\n\nI treat my angel investing the exact same way as I might back a Kickstarter project or invest in publicly traded companies on Robinhood; a way to build a portfolio of bets for things and people I believe in.\n\nDon’t let the size of the check discourage you about the value you bring. It’s more than you probably give yourself credit for. The cap table may be the ultimate seat at the table design needs to enable more representation in companies.

Let's look at the three reasons I see as forces of nature: continued mass layoffs, the rise of AI, and recovery from the recession.\n\nThe first is all the massive layoffs happening at tech companies at various levels. According to layoffs.fyi, 629 tech companies have laid off 185,136 employees in 2023, and we’re not even halfway through the year.

In addition to continued layoffs, companies will continue looking at ways to reduce workforce size through AI.\n\nFinally, we are still recovering from the recession that started in 2020. As I reflect from the gut (I am not an expert), it seems like we are not quite out of it yet.\n\nWhat have we learned from all this? Though it's sad about people losing their job through a layoff, I do believe tech has become way too bloated. What started with lean teams, raising just enough money for the runway, we over-indexed on company size, growth, and valuations. The recession has been a humbling experience and that can disappear. 2020 and 2021 are what I like to call the Clubhouse Valuation phase in tech. We over-indexed on companies that showed high value in a pandemic without considering what would happen on the road to recovery—a reminder that long-term thinking is crucial. Clubhouse, Peloton, and other companies that optimized for staying at home then dropped in 2022.\n\nLooking at the new bloom\nAt our Palm Springs house, we are lucky to have part of the San Janito Mountains be our next-door neighbor.

Every month or quarter (or whatever cadence), founders send a note to all investors to give them updates on metrics, product roadmap, burn rate, etc. I’ve found them exceptionally informative and also bring a lot of joy in hearing people’s successes. When it comes to your career or life ambitions, I’m a proponent of assembling a personal board of directors—trusted individuals who can give you guidance as you need. For the last few years, I’ve made an effort to keep them informed and updated on my progress—career advisor updates.\n\nI send updates twice a year to this group to keep them in the loop. In this issue, we’ll cover who is on your advisory, the benefits of sending updates, and ideas on how to write the content.\n\n## The advisory roster\nMentors and advisors are crucial supporting characters in your career journey. As you continue moving forward, it’s natural you won’t communicate with them as much as you did. You no longer work with them and people are busy. However, it’s important to foster these relationships along the way.

We've all experienced that icky feeling when someone comes out of the woodwork, wanting to catch up, only to reveal they need a favor from you. This doesn’t feel great. My rule-of-thumb is continually fostering relationships and if there is an ask, it naturally arises.\n\nEmail updates to your advisors invoke serendipitous moments. People I’ve managed from years ago on occasion send updates to me when they’re looking for a change. Their message sparks more intention for me to be on the lookout to point them in a direction they might be interested in.\n\n## Crafting an update\nLet's brainstorm a few places to start if you feel stuck on where to begin.\n\n### Start with a personal intro\nStart with a human intro and let your advisory know how things are going personally before jumping into business. Update on how life is going and how you’re doing.\n\n### Professional wins and challenges from the last six months\nThis is the bulk of the update—a recap you'd give to stakeholders. This advisory group knows you very well and can give you guidance other people cannot. When I write about something I'm struggling with professionally, they tend to come back with a lot of advice that is useful because they know my strengths, weaknesses, and ambitions.\n\n### Any requests or asks\nThey've helped you through your career and likely will continue to do so. For me, it's usually an FYI of something I'm interested in doing and asking them to keep an eye out if there is any serendipitous opportunity. Perhaps it's launching a side project or looking to get into advising.\n\n### Share your gratitude\nFinally, end it with gratitude—for yourself and them. They've been your backers and don't expect you to thank them. However, it's important to remind them what a spark they've been in your journey. A lot has changed since they were highly involved in your life and it's nice to share where you're developing. I like to mention that I grew in a certain area and how they helped me grow.\n\n## A few tips\nThough some advisors have become friends, I keep it professional. Here are a few tips and considerations.\n\n- Keep it brief: I try to keep my updates to about three paragraphs to keep people in the loop\n- Don’t spam: You're not growth hacking your advisors. If you're sending from your personal email, BCC everyone to keep it confidential.\n- Personalize it: There may be instances where you want to add additional context for certain people.\n\nWrite a quick update\nIt takes 10 to 15 minutes to draft an email update, select the contacts, and send it. People are busy, and you might not get a reply from your recipients. I guarantee. you that they'll read it and hearing from you will put a smile on their face.\n\nThis action to send an update to your advisors might seem obvious to do, but it's often the obvious things we forget to prioritize in life.

I empathize with those who feel frustrated about the discourse of a high bar for craft as they often are told it is important with no clear definition of the expectations.\n\nCraft refers to a skill or ability to create something by hand, often involving high precision, artistry, and expertise in using particular tools or materials. Craft emphasizes quality, technique, and a deep understanding of the materials, often with a focus on creating unique or custom items rather than mass-produced goods. In a broader sense, \"craft\" can also refer to the meticulous process of honing a skill or art form, regardless of whether it's physical (like woodworking, pottery, or metalworking) or intellectual (like writing or product design).\n\nPeople get annoyed about hearing about craft as they know being a good designer requires other skills to succeed: strong communication skills, a growth mindset, and ability to collaborate. However, I must share the hard truth.\n\nCraft is an unavoidable foundation as a designer.\n\nNot having strong craft foundations as a team member is like a basketball player who understands different plays, communicates well, and is a great teammate, but cannot shoot, pass, or dribble. Let's look at the three areas that craft elevates: culture, artifacts, and trust.\n\n## Craft represents culture\nAlastair Simpson, VP of Design at Dropbox, recently spoke at Leading Design London about 'Building a culture of craft.' In an interview with Simpson, he reflects:\n\n> I believe that design must be a strong cross-functional partner to any and every cross-functional discipline in order to have company and product wide impact. We have to also be product tinkers as well as designers. However, as designers, our number one priority must be our design craft and building products that solve our customers’ problems, and also delight them in moments that matter. We can’t lose sight or focus on the main thing that we are accountable for. The more passion we pour into our craft and creating outcomes we love, the more pride we have in our work. This feeds into the flywheel of culture and enabling a care for craft in everything that our company does.\n\nThe saying is,\" Culture is defined by the worst behavior you tolerate.\" I wholeheartedly believe in this statement 100%. This applies to the culture of collaboration how we respect one another, and to the craft of our work. If junior designers look at the Figma file of a lead designer, and it’s hard to use, that reflects what the team is willing to tolerate. This isn't about using frames/groups or auto layout, its how what you create is valuable for others. It may sound pedantic until you look at engineering excellence. They would not tolerate inconsistent code or unclear comments.\n\nLeading through the craft is caring about managing the work. Mistakes will happen and the culture of craft is putting the attention and care to fix them.\n\n## Well-crafted artifacts represent our work\nIn Issue 144, I wrote about Creating value with artifacts. Whether we like it or not, design value is contained in well-crafted artifacts. Look at the most important artifacts of our time: The Code of Hammurabi, the Rosetta Stone of Egypt, Terra Cotta Army in China, the Liberty Bell during the American Revolution, and the Autobot Matrix of Leadership from Cybertron. These artifacts are well-crafted and designed because of the story they hold to represent the work.\n\nThe digital artifacts we create such as keynote presentations, drawings of interfaces, research insights, and brand guidelines should also withstand the test of time. Design work is deep and intangible: hours of interviews with customers, understanding the codebase and technical feasibility, mapping out how the business works, etc. I understand it is frustrating to be great at these design skills and yet be assessed by the visuals of an artifact.\n\nJenn Spriggs once told our team a story of her lessons in fashion design that conveys this. Presenting the dress you’re working on with all the buttons facing out consistently allows focus on more important conversations. Getting all the details right gets stakeholders focused on the most important discussions. By creating well-crafted artifacts, we then focus on grander conversations.\n\n## Craft is trust\nDesign is about consistency, and consistency builds trust. If you have a high bar for craft, it increases the trust your teammates have for you. Let’s go back to the basketball example. When a teammate passes the ball to you on offense, your ability to consistently make shots increases trust exponentially. Scaling craft across an entire company is no small feat; a huge transformation. Increasing trustworthy craft means you know the teammate next to you will sweat the details as you should.\n\nIn software, excellence is often described as high performance, reliability, and addressing bug fixes. Engineering should not solely be responsible for upholding these standards and needs design, product, and other counterparts to uphold the level of quality together. If forms submitted are successful 99/100 times instead of 100/100, this is the beginning of trust erosion from our customers.\n\n## Recap\nTo be clear, designers with a high bar for craft without the work ethic, ability to respectfully collaborate, and articulate their work are key requirements to be a good designer. My point is not that other skills don’t matter—they do. However, there is a sequence of importance, and craft is first. This is why it’ll inevitably be the first thing you’re evaluated on. Improve on craft and invest the majority of your time in it. The rest will work itself out and unlock greater conversations.","src/content/writing/the-obsession-over-craft.md","f9be35535585c90f",{html:216,metadata:217},"<p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.proofofconcept.pub/p/the-obsession-over-craft\">Proof of Concept</a></p>\n<p>In conversations about software design (brand, product, content, etc.), the word you constantly hear now is craft.</p>\n<p>Recruiters will post they are looking for a designer with a high bar for craft.

This isn’t about using frames/groups or auto layout, its how what you create is valuable for others. It may sound pedantic until you look at engineering excellence. They would not tolerate inconsistent code or unclear comments.</p>\n<p>Leading through the craft is caring about managing the work. Mistakes will happen and the culture of craft is putting the attention and care to fix them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"well-crafted-artifacts-represent-our-work\">Well-crafted artifacts represent our work</h2>\n<p>In Issue 144, I wrote about Creating value with artifacts. Whether we like it or not, design value is contained in well-crafted artifacts. Look at the most important artifacts of our time: The Code of Hammurabi, the Rosetta Stone of Egypt, Terra Cotta Army in China, the Liberty Bell during the American Revolution, and the Autobot Matrix of Leadership from Cybertron. These artifacts are well-crafted and designed because of the story they hold to represent the work.</p>\n<p>The digital artifacts we create such as keynote presentations, drawings of interfaces, research insights, and brand guidelines should also withstand the test of time. Design work is deep and intangible: hours of interviews with customers, understanding the codebase and technical feasibility, mapping out how the business works, etc. I understand it is frustrating to be great at these design skills and yet be assessed by the visuals of an artifact.</p>\n<p>Jenn Spriggs once told our team a story of her lessons in fashion design that conveys this. Presenting the dress you’re working on with all the buttons facing out consistently allows focus on more important conversations. Getting all the details right gets stakeholders focused on the most important discussions. By creating well-crafted artifacts, we then focus on grander conversations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"craft-is-trust\">Craft is trust</h2>\n<p>Design is about consistency, and consistency builds trust. If you have a high bar for craft, it increases the trust your teammates have for you. Let’s go back to the basketball example. When a teammate passes the ball to you on offense, your ability to consistently make shots increases trust exponentially. Scaling craft across an entire company is no small feat; a huge transformation. Increasing trustworthy craft means you know the teammate next to you will sweat the details as you should.</p>\n<p>In software, excellence is often described as high performance, reliability, and addressing bug fixes. Engineering should not solely be responsible for upholding these standards and needs design, product, and other counterparts to uphold the level of quality together. If forms submitted are successful 99/100 times instead of 100/100, this is the beginning of trust erosion from our customers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recap\">Recap</h2>\n<p>To be clear, designers with a high bar for craft without the work ethic, ability to respectfully collaborate, and articulate their work are key requirements to be a good designer. My point is not that other skills don’t matter—they do. However, there is a sequence of importance, and craft is first. This is why it’ll inevitably be the first thing you’re evaluated on. Improve on craft and invest the majority of your time in it. The rest will work itself out and unlock greater conversations.</p>",{headings:218,imagePaths:231,frontmatter:232},[219,222,225,228],{depth:25,slug:220,text:221},"craft-represents-culture","Craft represents culture",{depth:25,slug:223,text:224},"well-crafted-artifacts-represent-our-work","Well-crafted artifacts represent our work",{depth:25,slug:226,text:227},"craft-is-trust","Craft is trust",{depth:25,slug:229,text:230},"recap","Recap",[],{title:210,pubDate:233,description:48},["Date","2024-03-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"the-obsession-over-craft.md","jodorowskys-product-roadmap",{id:235,data:237,body:240,filePath:241,digest:242,rendered:243,legacyId:250},{title:238,pubDate:239,description:48},"Jodorowsky’s Product Roadmap",["Date","2021-01-23T00:00:00.000Z"],"I’ll share two stories you may not have heard of. These are stories of “the greatest film never made” and “the most important dead company in Silicon Valley.” This is a story about what happens when projects with uncompromising visions collide with the production process to make it happen (and keep it alive).\n\nIn the 1970s, film director Alejandro Jodorowsky took on what people said was the impossible task, a film adaptation of Dune. If you don’t know who Jodorowsky is, he is a filmmaker known for his avant garde and wild ideas. Dune is a science fiction novel written by Frank Herbert in 1965 and considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written—the bible of science fiction. A film adaptation was often believed as impossible due to the epic length and many storylines of the novel.\n\nFrom the beginning, Jodorowsky had a grand vision, and names such as Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, and Pink Floyd were set to star in the film. He even offered to pay Dali a fee of $100,000 per hour. Personally, I think that’s a pretty good rate in 1974. Jororowsky had an uncompromising vision, proclaiming that there would be no script notes, and the film had to be produced 100% aligned with how he imagined it.\n\n![Jodorosky](/images/blog/img-2021-jodorowskysbacklog-02.jpg)\n\n\nIn addition to the star power of the on-screen talent, the designers who Jodorowsky recruited might be lesser known to the general public, but perhaps a larger impact. This design cast included Chris Foss (a well known science fiction cover artist), Jean Giraud (better known as Moebius in the comic book world), and H.R. Giger. Jodoroswky would lead his team of spiritual warriors who would make Dune come to life on the big screen.\n\n\n![Artwork and storyboards created by the amazing Mobius](/images/blog/img-2021-jodorowskysbacklog-01.jpg)\n\nThe team of spiritual warriors spent $2 million of the $9.5 budget on pre-production with the film being about 14 hours long, and he wanted the film to be 20 hours. No rational production studio would take the risk on Jodoroswky’s massive vision, the hope of this film actually being produced collapsed. With the project dead, the rights were sold to producer Dino De Laurentiis in 1984 (yes, he’s the grandfather of Giada from The Food Network), who ultimately hired David Lynch to direct. All that was left in Jodorowsky’s Dune was a book of concepts and storyboards the size of a yellow pages phone book.\n\n_The dream was over._\n\nJodorowsky’s Dune is a prime example of an compromised vision that never made it to reality, and there are many other industries that have similar stories, such as technology and startups. Let’s take a look at another story in Silicon Valley. You have not heard of General Magic, but you are likely familiar with the iPod, iPhone, and Android phones.\n\nThe year was 1989 and Apple Inc. headed by John Scully, the former Pepsi CEO who co-founder Steve Jobs hired, and ultimately was fired by. Without Jobs at the helm, the computer company was looking for new product innovation. Apple employee Marc Porat, known for his entrepreneurial spirit and big ideas, convinced Scully that the future of computing would be a partnership of computer, communications and consumer electronics companies. Known as the Paradigm project, the initiative lacked traction internally at Apple. Porat took the initiative and spun it out as its own company separate from Apple. General Magic was born. Porat recruited two key Apple engineers, Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson to join this ragtag team of magicians to build the future of computing.\n\n\n![Photo of the team at General Magic](/images/blog/img-2021-general-magic.jpg)\n\nGeneral Magic’s worked on an operating system called Magic Cap designed with mobile computing in mind, which was a wild idea in the early 90s when you still had to call the internet to connect. Magic Cap used the metaphor of rooms as a virtual office you could navigate on your mobile device. General Magic was able to get further in production than Jodorowsky simply by existing and still having money to work on their vision.\n\nAs the General Magic team continued to innovate in the future, Apple would release a portable digital assistant called the Apple Newton. This was done with Scully still as CEO of Apple and without General Magic’s knowledge. The product was a flop. From a vision and execution perspective, if General Magic was Jodorowsky’s Dune, then the Apple Newton was David Lynch’s Dune.\n\nGeneral Magic was able to get further than Jodorowsky’s Dune in terms of tangible results, but they also struggled with compromising on their vision. Somehow, the company was able to IPO in 1995 without an actual product, likely with investors making a bet on the team’s vision that still hasn’t been productionalized. Four years after their IPO and finally a product rushed to market without major adoption by consumers.\n\n_The dream was over._\n\nThe greatest film never made and Silicon Valley’s most important dead startup never achieved their visions. Or did they? How is success defined? Is there such a thing as being too ahead of your time, or the vision being too big? Without such big dreams, would we continue to build a faster horse?\n\nShould these two visions have compromised in order to survive? In hindsight, some may argue they should have, but would it have been the same impact?\n\nWhat remained in the concept art from Jodorowsky’s Dune lived on in a way the film director unlikely hoped for. George Lucas would create a little known film called Star Wars in 1977. In one of the most iconic opening scenes in film history, it was very reminiscent of Dune’s storyboards for the opening. H.R. Giger, one of Jodorowsky’s artists on Dune went on to work with Ridley Scott in the Sci-Fi horror film Alien. Giger brought his work style into the film that let the world know that in space, no one can hear you scream. Ridley Scott also was approached by Dino DeLaurentiis about directing Dune (The David Lynch one). Due to a personal tragedy, Scott dropped out and upon returning instead directed a film called Blade Runner, who borrowed work from Moebius for the art direction.\n\nThe list of former General Magic employees reads like a hall of fame of tech giants. Tony Fadell went on to invent the iPod, co-invent the iPhone, and start Nest. Megan Smith went on to be a VP at Google. Kevin Lynch went on to create a design/code editing software called Dreamweaver and went on to be a lead engineer on Apple Watch. He’s also the Apple exec often mistaken to be Bill Gates due to their resemblance. Andy Hertzfeld invented Google Circles which led to Google+ (he did useful things too!). Andy Rubin went on to invent the Android operating system later acquired by Google. He also is a really terrible human being so we’ll stop there. Even the low level employees found success after General Magic. Pierre Omidyar left the scrappy startup to start his own company, which he called eBay.\n\n46 years after Jodorowsky first put together his phonebook-sized vision book, acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve will take on the ambitious project of Dune. With films like Prisoners, Siccario, Arrival, and Blade Runner 2049 on his resume, there is no doubt that the work of Jodoroswky’s concept book inspired Villeneuve.\n\nTony Faddell was just a college grad when he worked at General Magic and endured a decade of trials and tribulations working at the struggling startup. As Faddell once said in an interview, “I literally had a decade of failure.” Faddell would later go on to invent the iPod, be co-creator of the iPhone, and the Nest thermostat. It is quite possible the greatest value General Magic shipped was Tony himself.\n\nAs someone who works in startups and tech, there are multiple definitions of success and failure. For an investor, success might be scaling to a lucrative IPO for huge returns. For a founder, it might also be that, however, it could also be pursuing an uncompromising vision to change the world. The majority of startups die before their vision is even realized and never make it to market. However, some uncompromising visions often explore like a supernova spreading its cosmic influence for those to continue the work.\n\nPerhaps the greatest failures at fulfilling a grand vision bore spores of inspiration for others to continue the work for countless generations.","src/content/writing/jodorowskys-product-roadmap.md","2b3bfe621e8cd0dc",{html:244,metadata:245},"<p>I’ll share two stories you may not have heard of.
