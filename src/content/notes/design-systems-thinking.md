Design systems are often reduced to component libraries, but that misses the forest for the trees. A true design system is a **way of thinking**—a shared language and set of principles that guide how a team approaches problems.

## Components are outputs, not inputs

When teams start with components, they're working backwards. Components should emerge from understanding:

- What problems are we solving?
- What patterns keep recurring?
- Where do we need consistency vs. flexibility?

## The three layers

I think about design systems in three layers:

1. **Principles** — The "why" behind decisions
2. **Patterns** — Reusable solutions to common problems
3. **Components** — The tangible building blocks

Most teams jump straight to layer 3 and wonder why adoption is hard.

## Living systems

The best design systems evolve. They're not perfect—they're **good enough, and improving**. This requires:

- Regular audits and pruning
- Clear contribution models
- Measuring what matters (adoption, consistency, velocity)

The goal isn't to build a perfect system. It's to build a system that makes the team more effective.
