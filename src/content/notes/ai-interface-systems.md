Early thoughts on how AI is fundamentally changing interface design...

**Terminal / Command Line**
    - **Traditional OS:** CLI (bash, zsh)
    - **AI OS:** LLMs (text, voice)
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Language becomes the universal command surface
        - Power shifts from syntax → intent interpretation
        - Prompting evolves into command composition and reuse
- **Process Manager**
    - **Traditional OS:** init, schedulers, background processes
    - **AI OS:** Agents
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Execution becomes continuous, not request/response
        - Agents decide _when_ to act, not just _how_
        - Orchestration over time becomes the core capability
- **Kernel**
    - **Traditional OS:** Resource coordination, system rules
    - **AI OS:** Plans (and logs)
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Plans are no longer documents; they are coordination primitives
        - They constrain execution across humans + machines
        - Planning shifts from prediction to alignment and constraint
- **Filesystem**
    - **Traditional OS:** Files, directories, permissions
    - **AI OS:** Information in files (not apps)
    - **What’s changing:**
        - “File over app” becomes foundational (Kepano’s philosophy)
        - Apps stop being the source of truth; files do
        - Memory moves from opaque storage → inspectable structure
- **File Formats**
    - **Traditional OS:** Fixed formats (.doc, .jpg, .mp3)
    - **AI OS:** Multimodal, metadata-rich files that can mutate and change based on context while retaining the original form
    - **What’s changing:**
        - A “file” becomes a bundle of structured data + intent
        - Content can transform across text, audio, image, summary, plan
        - Format is no longer presentation-specific, but capability-specific
- **RAM / Working Memory**
    - **Traditional OS:** Volatile memory
    - **AI OS:** Context windows
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Context is abundant but fragile
        - Systems confuse recall with understanding
        - Long-term value comes from promoting context → files → plans
- **Device Drivers**
    - **Traditional OS:** Hardware drivers
    - **AI OS:** Tools, APIs, system actions
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Models don’t act directly; drivers translate intent into execution
        - Tool reliability becomes system stability
        - Permissions and scope become first-order concerns
- **Window Manager / Views**
    - **Traditional OS:** Desktop environment   
    - **AI OS:** Apps as Views
    - **What’s changing:**
        - MVC decouples: models ≠ views ≠ controllers
        - Apps stop being “systems” and become projections of state
        - The same underlying data can render across many surfaces
- **Interface Layer**
    - **Traditional OS:** GUI, input devices
    - **AI OS:** Dynamic, state-aware interfaces
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Interfaces respond to what the system _knows_, not just user input
        - Chat is a bootstrap UI, not the end state
        - IDEs and OSes evolve toward adaptive, context-revealing surfaces   
- **Interoperability Layer**
    - **Traditional OS:** IPC, system calls
    - **AI OS:** Interoperability (not integrations)
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Systems coordinate through shared primitives, not brittle glue code
        - IDEs and OSes become peers in a larger execution environment
        - Data, plans, and actions flow across boundaries by default
- **Security & Permissions**
    - **Traditional OS:** Users, roles, sandboxing
    - **AI OS:** Identity, consent, memory access
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Personalization requires explicit permission models
        - Memory access becomes as sensitive as file access
        - Without this, intelligence defaults to surveillance
- **Logs & Observability**
    - **Traditional OS:** Logs, stack traces, system monitors
    - **AI OS:** Decision traces, plan diffs, tool histories
    - **What’s changing:**
        - Trust comes from inspectability, not confidence scores
        - Systems must explain _what happened_, not just answer
        - Debugging intelligence becomes a core UX problem
