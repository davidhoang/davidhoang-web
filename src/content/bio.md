## Speaker bio

I'm a designer, investor, and builder focused on tools that revolutionize the internet. I currently serve as VP of Design, Rovo & AI at [Atlassian](http://atlassian.com), building AI experiences that will use Jira for me so I never have to. Prior, I was VP of Marketing and Design at [Replit](http://replit.com), where I led rebranding, launched developer events, and pushed forward new ways to ship AI-native products. I was also the first Head of Design at [Webflow](http://webflow.com), where I helped scale both the team and the company's vision for a more expressive, accessible internet. Prior to that, I led product design at [One Medical](http://onemedical.com) during its transition to virtual care and eventual IPO.

I invest in and advise early-stage startups, especially creative tools that empower people to express on the internet. I've invested in over 30 early-stage companies: [Sunflower](https://sunflower.me/), [Daydream](https://www.withdaydream.com/), [OZU](https://explore.ozu.ai/), [Galileo (acquired)](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/), [Flint](https://www.tryflint.com/), and [Paper](https://paper.design/), to name a few. I also write a weekly newsletter called [Proof of Concept](http://www.proofofconcept.pub), where I explore ideas around software, design, and entrepreneurship.

## Medium

I'm a designer, investor, and builder focused on tools that revolutionize the internet. My career has been an [odyssey](/career-odyssey)—20 years in and still so much to learn and experience. My love for design and software began after graduating with a BFA in Drawing and Painting. Interdisciplinary studies led me to electives in Computer Science, Art History, and the Humanities. After matriculation, I took what's now called a gap year to prepare for an MFA; I never went, instead designing app interfaces for a new device called the iPhone.

Since then, I've spent my career building and scaling design teams at early-stage startups and high-growth companies. I currently serve as VP of Design, Rovo & AI at [Atlassian](http://atlassian.com), building AI experiences that will use Jira for me so I never have to. Prior, I was VP of Marketing and Design at [Replit](http://replit.com), where I led rebranding, launched developer events, and pushed forward new ways to ship AI-native products.

I also write a weekly newsletter called [Proof of Concept](http://www.proofofconcept.pub), where I explore ideas around software, design, and entrepreneurship. It's a space for me to reflect on the shifting landscape of technology and how we build within it.

I'm particularly interested in how AI is reshaping software architecture and the way we build. I explore ideas like [the emerging MVC](/writing/a-new-mvc-is-emerging)—where LLMs become models, apps become views, and agents become controllers—and how we're moving from app-centric to system-centric experiences. I think deeply about [design engineering](/writing/design-engineering) as the transformative practice of the 2020s, the intersection of technical systems and interface quality. I'm fascinated by [the future of software](/writing/the-four-types-of-software-in-the-future)—from boutique experiences to personal and disposable software—and how the lowering barriers to creation are democratizing who can build. I also reflect on the role of craft and taste in design, how tech goes through factory reset moments, and what it means to build creative tools that empower expression on the internet.
