I led product design at One Medical during one of the most transformative periods in the company's history. The challenge was clear: evolve primary care from a traditional in-person model to a hybrid approach that combined the best of physical and virtual care.

## The Transition to Virtual Care

When I joined, One Medical was already reimagining primary care with technology. But the shift to virtual care required rethinking everything—from how patients scheduled appointments to how doctors conducted visits. We weren't just digitizing existing processes; we were creating entirely new care delivery models.

The design work involved understanding the nuanced needs of both patients and providers. Patients needed care that felt personal and accessible, while providers needed tools that enhanced rather than complicated their practice.

## Designing for Healthcare

Healthcare design comes with unique constraints and responsibilities. Every decision we made had real implications for people's health and wellbeing. This required a level of care and thoughtfulness that went beyond typical product design.

We focused on creating experiences that reduced friction in healthcare—making it easier to get care when you need it, whether that was through the app, a video visit, or in-person at one of our offices.

## The IPO Journey

Leading design through One Medical's IPO was a unique experience. It meant ensuring our product vision aligned with the company's public narrative, while also maintaining focus on the day-to-day work of improving patient and provider experiences.

The IPO wasn't just a financial milestone—it validated that design-led healthcare companies could scale and succeed. It showed that putting patient experience at the center of product development wasn't just the right thing to do, it was good business.

## Impact

The work at One Medical reinforced my belief that design can transform industries, even ones as complex and regulated as healthcare. The experiences we designed helped make primary care more accessible and human-centered, proving that technology could enhance rather than replace the human elements of care.

The lessons from One Medical—about designing for regulated industries, balancing innovation with safety, and creating experiences that serve both end users and providers—have shaped how I approach design challenges in every industry since.
