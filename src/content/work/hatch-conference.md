In September 2024, I had the honor of delivering a keynote at Hatch Conference titled "Design & (Blank)." The talk explored the evolving landscape of design, particularly in an era where AI is reshaping how we create and think about design work.

## The Talk

"Design & (Blank)" was an exploration of what design means today and where it's heading. The title itself was intentionally open-ended—a recognition that design is constantly intersecting with new fields, technologies, and ways of thinking.

The talk came at a pivotal moment in the industry. AI tools were becoming more sophisticated, the role of designers was shifting, and there was a growing conversation about what design work would look like in the future.

## Key Themes

The keynote addressed several critical themes facing designers today:

### Design in the Age of AI

As AI tools become more capable, the question isn't whether designers will be replaced, but how the role of design will evolve. The talk explored how designers can work with AI rather than against it, using these tools to amplify creativity rather than diminish it.

### The Expanding Definition of Design

Design is no longer just about making things look good. It's about systems thinking, user experience, product strategy, and increasingly, understanding how to work with complex technologies. The "(Blank)" in the title represented all the new intersections design is finding.

### Craft in a commoditized World

When tools make certain aspects of design easier, what becomes the differentiator? The answer, as always, comes back to craft, taste, and the ability to solve real problems for real people.
