General Assembly was a pivotal platform for design education, offering intensive bootcamp-style courses that helped people transition into tech careers. As a UXD (User Experience Design) instructor, I had the opportunity to shape how new designers entered the field.

## The Role

Teaching at General Assembly meant working with students who were making significant career transitions. Many were coming from completely different fields, bringing fresh perspectives but needing to learn design fundamentals quickly.

## The Curriculum

The UXD course covered the full spectrum of user experience design—from research and strategy through prototyping and testing. The challenge was balancing depth with the intensive timeline of a bootcamp program.

## The Impact

Teaching reinforced my own understanding of design fundamentals. Explaining concepts to students forced me to clarify my own thinking and find better ways to communicate complex ideas. It was also rewarding to see students go from complete beginners to landing their first design roles.

## Lessons Learned

The experience of teaching at General Assembly highlighted the importance of accessible design education. Many students came from non-traditional backgrounds, and the program demonstrated that design skills could be learned by anyone with the right instruction and dedication.

The work also reinforced how design education needs to evolve with the industry. As tools and practices change, curriculum needs to stay current while also teaching timeless principles that will serve students throughout their careers.
