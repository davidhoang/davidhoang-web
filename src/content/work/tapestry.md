In this era where the fundamentals of software is changing, leaders must build or face becoming irrelevant. I've been vibe coding a project that I'm ready to promote it to an Alpha. Introducing Tapestry: high touch design recruiting in the intelligence era.

## The Problem

I've been a hiring manager for more than a decade, and over time built a personal CRM of designers I recommend. I get asked from trusted recruiters if I know someone who might be a good fit. Often, I need to go back to the rolodex.

The challenge isn't just remembering who's in your network—it's about making the right connections at the right time. Traditional recruiting tools focus on volume and matching algorithms, but they miss the nuance of personal relationships and context that comes from years of working with talented designers.

## The Solution

Tapestry uses AI to elevate the human experience, not replace it. Its intention is not to replace connection with slop but use AI to help me make better recommendations.

The platform intelligently curates your personal network of design talent, making it easy to find the right person for the right opportunity. It's built on the principle that the best recommendations come from people who actually know the talent—not from algorithms scraping LinkedIn profiles.

## Built with Modern Tools

I made this with Replit and Visual Electric. The project represents what's possible when you combine modern development tools with AI capabilities to solve real problems you face in your work.

## The Approach

Tapestry is what I call "vibe coding"—building something quickly, iterating based on feel, and seeing where it leads. Without the constraints of a product roadmap or business requirements, I could explore ideas that might not fit into traditional product development cycles.

This approach has been liberating. It's a reminder that not everything needs to be a company or a startup. Sometimes the best work comes from simply making something because you're curious about what's possible.
