Tapestry is a personal project I've been building as an exploration of new ways to create and share design work. It's what I call "vibe coding"—building something quickly, iterating based on feel, and seeing where it leads.

## The Experiment

In an era where AI is changing how we build, Tapestry represents my way of staying close to the craft. It's not about building the perfect product or solving a massive problem—it's about the process of making, experimenting, and learning.

The project emerged from a desire to explore new interaction patterns and ways of presenting creative work. It's built with modern web technologies, but the focus is on experimentation over optimization.

## Vibe Coding Philosophy

"Vibe coding" is about trusting your instincts and moving fast. It's the opposite of over-engineering or planning every detail upfront. Instead, it's about building something, seeing how it feels, and iterating from there.

This approach has been liberating. Without the constraints of a product roadmap or business requirements, I can explore ideas that might not fit into traditional product development cycles.

## Personal Projects as Practice

Tapestry reminds me why I got into design and development in the first place—the joy of making something from nothing. Personal projects like this are essential for staying sharp, exploring new ideas, and maintaining the creative energy that fuels professional work.

It's a reminder that not everything needs to be a company or a startup. Sometimes the best work comes from simply making something because you're curious about what's possible.

## The Future

Tapestry continues to evolve as I experiment with new ideas and patterns. It's a living project that changes based on what I'm learning and exploring. The goal isn't to launch or scale—it's to keep creating and see where it leads.
