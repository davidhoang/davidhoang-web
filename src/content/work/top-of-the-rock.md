Top of the Rock is one of New York City's most iconic observation decks, offering stunning views of Manhattan. The design work focused on creating digital experiences that complemented the physical visit.

Designing for a physical destination requires thinking about how digital and physical experiences intersect. The work needed to enhance the visit while also serving users who were planning their trip or reliving memories afterward.

## The Approach

The design emphasized the visual experience and the history of the location. High-quality photography showcased the views, while thoughtful information architecture helped visitors plan their visit and understand what to expect.

## Impact

Working on destination experiences reinforced the importance of understanding the full customer journey—from initial discovery through the physical experience to post-visit engagement. The work needed to serve multiple user needs across different touchpoints.
