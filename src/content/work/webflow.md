I joined Webflow as the first Head of Design, at a time when the company was redefining how websites are built. The mission was clear: create tools that revolutionize the internet by making web design more expressive and accessible.

## Building the Design Foundation

As the first design leader, I had the opportunity to shape not just the product, but the entire design practice at Webflow. This meant building the team from the ground up, establishing design systems, and creating processes that would scale as the company grew.

The challenge was balancing the need to move fast with the importance of building a strong foundation. We needed to ship features that would delight users while also creating systems that would support the company's long-term vision.

## Scaling the Team

One of the most rewarding aspects of this role was building and scaling the design team. I focused on hiring designers who weren't just skilled in their craft, but who understood the unique challenges of building an authoring tool—a product where the interface itself becomes the canvas for creation.

We built a team that could think beyond traditional UI design, understanding both the technical constraints and the creative possibilities of a visual web builder.

## Vision for an Expressive Internet

Webflow's vision was always bigger than just a tool—it was about empowering people to create on the web without code. As Head of Design, I worked closely with product and engineering to ensure that vision was reflected in every interaction, every feature, and every decision we made.

The work at Webflow reinforced my belief in the power of design tools that bridge the gap between design and development. It's where I saw firsthand how the right tools can democratize creation and make the web more expressive.

## Impact

During my time at Webflow, the company grew significantly, and the design team became a core part of how the product evolved. The foundation we built supported the company's continued growth and helped establish Webflow as a leader in the no-code movement.

The experience of being the first design leader at a company taught me invaluable lessons about building design practices, scaling teams, and maintaining design quality while moving fast—lessons I've carried forward in every role since.
