Vowch was a social commerce platform that combined discovery, curation, and shopping. The work involved designing experiences that made product discovery feel social and engaging.

## The Challenge

Social commerce requires balancing multiple user needs: discovery, curation, sharing, and purchasing. The design needed to make these activities feel seamless and interconnected rather than separate features.

## The Approach

The design emphasized visual discovery and social interaction. Users could browse curated collections, follow tastemakers, and easily share products they loved. The interface prioritized imagery and made it easy to move from inspiration to purchase.

## Impact

Vowch represented an early exploration of social commerce—a category that has since become central to how many people discover products online. The work provided valuable experience in designing for social interactions around commerce.
