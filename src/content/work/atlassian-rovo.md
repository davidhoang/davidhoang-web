Rovo is Atlassian's AI-powered solution designed to transform how teams access and work with organizational knowledge. As VP and Head of Design, AI at Atlassian, I led the design vision for Rovo—a product that represents the future of AI-native work tools.

## The Vision

Rovo was built to solve a fundamental problem: knowledge is scattered across countless tools and platforms. Teams waste time switching between Jira, Confluence, Google Drive, Microsoft SharePoint, GitHub, Slack, and more, just to find the information they need. Rovo breaks down these silos by creating a unified interface for accessing organizational knowledge.

## Key Features

### Unified Search

Rovo allows users to perform comprehensive searches across all connected applications, providing relevant information without the need to switch between platforms. The design challenge was creating a search experience that felt intelligent and contextual, understanding not just what users were searching for, but why.

### AI-Powered Chat

The chat functionality offers intelligent responses and insights by leveraging data from integrated tools. Designing this required thinking about how AI should surface information—not just answering questions, but proactively providing context and connections that users might not have known to ask for.

### Studio for Customization

Rovo's Studio enables teams to build custom AI agents tailored to their specific workflows. This was one of the most exciting design challenges: creating a tool that lets non-technical users build sophisticated AI agents for tasks like content generation, code reviews, and project management.

### Teamwork Graph

The Teamwork Graph connects teams, work, and applications on a single platform, ensuring that Rovo understands the unique context of your business. The design needed to make these connections visible and useful, helping users understand relationships they might not have seen before.

## Design Philosophy

Designing Rovo required rethinking how AI should feel in a work context. It's not just about adding AI features to existing products—it's about creating experiences that feel natural, helpful, and trustworthy. The design needed to make AI feel like a capable teammate, not a tool you have to learn.

## The Launch

Rovo launched as part of Atlassian's broader AI strategy, included in all paid Jira, Confluence, and Jira Service Management subscriptions. The rollout was gradual, with Standard, Premium, and Enterprise customers receiving access over the coming months.

## Impact

Rovo represents a new category of work tool—one that understands context, connects information, and helps teams work more intelligently. The design work on Rovo has informed how we think about AI-native experiences across all of Atlassian's products.

The project reinforced my belief that the best AI tools don't replace human judgment—they amplify it. Rovo helps teams access information faster and make better decisions, but it's designed to enhance human capabilities rather than automate them away.
