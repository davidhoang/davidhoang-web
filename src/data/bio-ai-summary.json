I currently lead product at Convex, a startup building developer tools to accelerate the adoption of machine learning. Before Convex, I was Head of Product at Rippling, where I helped grow the company from an idea to a multi-product platform used by thousands of businesses.  \n\nOutside of my day job, I'm passionate about the intersection of technology, community, and personal growth. I write about these topics on my blog and podcast, where I explore how we can use technology to live more intentional and fulfilling lives. I'm also the founder of a community called SoftwareSocial, which brings together product folks for peer learning and mutual support.\n\nIn my free time, you'll find me reading, rock climbing, or exploring the outdoors. I'm fascinated by how we can use technology to augment our human potential, and I'm always eager to connect with others who share this curiosity. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!",
