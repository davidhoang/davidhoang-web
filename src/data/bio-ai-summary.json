  "content": "I'm a designer, investor, and builder focused on tools that revolutionize the internet. I currently serve as VP of Design, Rovo & AI at Atlassian, building AI experiences that will use Jira for me so I never have to. My career has been an odyssey—20 years in and still so much to learn. Prior to Atlassian, I was VP of Marketing and Design at Replit, where I led rebranding, launched developer events, and pushed forward new ways to ship AI-native products. I was also the first Head of Design at Webflow, helping scale both the team and the company's vision for a more expressive, accessible internet. Before that, I led product design at One Medical during its transition to virtual care and eventual IPO.\n\nI invest in and advise early-stage startups, especially creative tools that empower people to express on the internet. I've invested in over 30 early-stage companies including Sunflower, Daydream, OZU, Galileo (acquired), Flint, and Paper, to name a few. I also write a weekly newsletter called Proof of Concept, where I explore ideas around software, design, and entrepreneurship.\n\nI'm particularly interested in how AI is reshaping software architecture and the way we build—from the emerging MVC where LLMs become models and agents become controllers, to design engineering as the transformative practice of the 2020s. My love for design and software began after graduating with a BFA in Drawing and Painting, and I never looked back.",
