        <p>I'm a designer, investor, and builder focused on tools that revolutionize the internet. I have 20 years experience in software and still have much to learn. My love for design and software began after graduating with a BFA in Drawing and Painting. Interdisciplinary studies led me to electives in Computer Science, Art History, and the Humanities. After matriculation, I took what's now called a gap year to prepare for an MFA; I never went, instead designing app interfaces for a new device called the iPhone.</p>

        <p>Since then, I've spent my career building and scaling design teams at early-stage startups and high-growth companies. Today, I serve as VP and Head of Design, AI at <a href="http://atlassian.com" target="_blank">Atlassian</a>, where I'm helping shape the future of work through generative AI and systems design. Before that, I was VP of Marketing and Design at <a href="http://replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a>, where I led rebranding, launched developer events, and pushed forward new ways to ship AI-native products. I was also the first Head of Design at <a href="http://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, where I helped scale both the team and the company's vision for a more expressive, accessible internet. Prior to that, I led product design at <a href="http://onemedical.com" target="_blank">One Medical</a> during its transition to virtual care and eventual IPO.</p>
        <p>Alongside my full-time roles, I invest in and advise early-stage startups—especially those working at the intersection of creativity, code, and community. Since 2020, I've invested in over 30 companies. I also write a weekly newsletter called <a href="http://www.proofofconcept.pub">Proof of Concept</a>, where I explore ideas around software, design, and entrepreneurship. It's a space for me to reflect on the shifting landscape of technology and how we build within it.</p>
        <p>I split my time between Palm Springs and San Francisco, but my work tends to follow me wherever I go. Mobility, constraint, and improvisation have always been part of how I work—whether that's prototyping on an iPad mid-flight or rewriting product strategy in a notebook at a coffee shop.</p>
