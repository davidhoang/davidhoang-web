        <p>I'm a designer, investor, and builder investing in tools that revolutionize the internet. I'm known as DH at work, but you can also call me David. I'm early in my career with 20 years experience in the industry. The love for design and software started when I graduated from college with my BFA in Drawing and Painting. My studies encouraged multi-disciplinary studies and led to me taking electives in Computer Science, Art History,  and the Humanities. Upon matriculation, I took what's now called a gap year to prepare for my MFA. I never did, and instead started designing app interfaces for a new device called the iPhone.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Since then, I’ve spent my career building and scaling design teams at early-stage startups and high-growth companies. Today, I serve as VP and Head of Design, AI at Atlassian, where I’m helping shape the future of work through generative AI and systems design. Before that, I was VP of Marketing and Design at Replit, where I led rebranding, launched developer events, and pushed forward new ways to ship AI-native products. I was also the first Head of Design at <a href="http://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow, where I helped scale both the team and the company’s vision for a more expressive, accessible internet. Prior to that, I led product design at <a href="http://onemedical.com" target="_blank"></a>One Medical</a> during its transition to virtual care and eventual IPO.</p>
        <p>Alongside my full-time roles, I invest in and advise early-stage startups—especially those working at the intersection of creativity, code, and community. Since 2020, I’ve invested in over 30 companies. I also write a weekly newsletter called _Proof of Concept_, where I explore ideas around software, design, and entrepreneurship. It’s a space for me to reflect on the shifting landscape of technology and how we build within it.</p>
        <p>I split my time between Palm Springs and San Francisco, but my work tends to follow me wherever I go. Mobility, constraint, and improvisation have always been a part of how I work—whether that’s prototyping on an iPad mid-flight or rewriting product strategy in a notebook at a coffee shop.</p>
